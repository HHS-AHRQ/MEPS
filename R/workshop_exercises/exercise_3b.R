# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DESCRIPTION:  THIS PROGRAM ILLUSTRATES HOW TO POOL MEPS LONGITUDINAL DATA
#  FILES FROM DIFFERENT PANELS
#
# THE EXAMPLE USED IS PANELS 17-19 POPULATION AGE 26-30 WHO ARE UNINSURED BUT
#  HAVE HIGH INCOME IN THE FIRST YEAR
#
# DATA FROM PANELS 17, 18, AND 19 ARE POOLED.
#
# INPUT FILES:  (1) C:/MEPS/H183.ssp (PANEL 19 LONGITUDINAL FILE)
# 	            (2) C:/MEPS/H172.ssp (PANEL 18 LONGITUDINAL FILE)
# 	            (3) C:/MEPS/H164.ssp (PANEL 17 LONGITUDINAL FILE)
