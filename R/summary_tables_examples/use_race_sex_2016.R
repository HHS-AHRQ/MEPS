# Example R code to replicate the following estimates in the MEPS-HC summary
#  tables, by race and sex:
#  - number of people
#  - percent of population with an expense
#  - total expenditures
#  - mean expenditure per person
#  - mean expenditure per person with expense
#  - median expenditure per person with expense
