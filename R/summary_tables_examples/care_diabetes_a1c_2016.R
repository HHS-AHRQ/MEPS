# Diabetes care survey (DCS):
#  Adults receiving hemoglobin A1c blood test

# Example R code to replicate number and percentage of adults with diabetes
#  who had a hemoglobin A1c blood test, by race/ethnicity
#
# Input file: C:/MEPS/h192.ssp (2016 full-year consolidated)

# Install/load packages and set global options --------------------------------

# Load packages (need to run every session)
